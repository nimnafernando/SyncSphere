SyncSphere is an event planning and management app that provides users with a structured system for task tracking, vendor management, expense monitoring, and reminder push notifications. With an intuitive and feature-rich interface, SyncSphere enables users to set deadlines, track milestones, and remotely coordinate events, making planning seamless and efficient.
The app follows an MVVM architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The project promotes team collaboration, design justification, and comparison between similar apps, aligning with academic learning outcomes.

How SyncSphere is Different from Existing Event Planner Apps

1. Comprehensive Task & Expense Tracking
Unlike apps like Eventbrite or Cvent, which focus mainly on ticketing and event promotion, SyncSphere prioritizes detailed task and budget management.
Users can track expenses alongside task progress—something missing in many existing event planner apps.

2. Vendor Coordination & Contract Management
Unlike traditional event planning apps that focus on helping users manage vendor contracts and track expenses.
Current apps do not integrate vendor coordination as a core feature—this makes SyncSphere a full-fledged event management tool rather than just a scheduler.

3. Remote Event Reporting & Real-Time Updates
Unlike apps like Cvent, which primarily serve corporate events, SyncSphere allows users to monitor and share real-time event progress with user reminders.
The app provides live task completion tracking, ensuring seamless communication between multiple tasks.

4. Color-Coordinated Event Categories for Better Visibility
Unlike other event planning apps, SyncSphere uses color-coded event categories to help users visually differentiate between different types of events (e.g., food, travel, photograph etc.).
This enhances user experience and organization, making it easier to track multiple events at a glance.

SyncSphere is a comprehensive event management and organisation solution that addresses the gaps left by competing platforms, not just another app for event planning. Compared to more traditional apps like Eventbrite, Cvent, or Eventify, SyncSphere provides a more organised and thorough approach by prioritising work tracking, expense management, vendor collaboration, and real-time updates.
